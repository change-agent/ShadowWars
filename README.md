# ShadowWars
Project 1 for SWEN20003: Object Oriented Software Development 2018 (Semester 1)

Shadow Wars includes a single player spaceship that can be moved around the screen with the arrow keys. The spacebar fires a laser shot at the enemy droids, and if the shot connects, the droids are destroyed. Similarly, if the player is unfortunate enough to run into the droids, the game ends.
